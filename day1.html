    A Computer <b>understands</b> only <large>binary</large> language and executes instructions coded in binary language.
It cannot execute a single instruction given in any other form. Therefore, we must provide
instructions to the <small>computer</small> in binary language. Means we must write computer programs entirely
in binary language (sequence of 0s and 1s).</p1>
<p2>But think for a while, how cumbersome programming would have been, if we have to write every
program as a sequence of 0s and 1s? It would have been a nightmare to write complex software's.
Humans are good at giving instructions in English language, whereas computers can only process
binary language. </p2>
